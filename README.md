# Instacart-Product-Recommendation-System-and-Analysis

## Introduction

Instacart, a popular online grocery delivery service, is operational in 5500+ cities in the USA and Canada, with 600+ partners serving 9.6 million users as of 2023. In this project, we propose the development of an Instacart Market Basket Analysis and Recommendation System using a globally distributed, multi-model NoSQL database system, Azure Cosmos DB. This system will analyze customer purchase history, recommend products based on their purchase history, and suggest similar preferences. Here, we are aiming to leverage the multi-model nature of Azure Cosmos DB and explore its graph functionalities to gain insights on relationships between products and their location
 

This system will analyze customer purchase history and recommend products based on their preferences. We will also perform an analysis of the recommendation system to evaluate its effectiveness and identify potential areas for improvement.


## Objectives

•	Representing orders and prior orders as a document database to improve recommendation accuracy.

•	Using a document-graph hybrid model to analyse and visualize relationships between customers and the products they ordered, visualize the location of products that are more likely to be reordered.

•	Analysing the details, frequency, and customer preferences of the most frequently ordered products.

•	The goal of the project is to understand, design, develop, and implement ETL pipelines to understand the internal working of the data workflows.

•	Understand and utilize a host of services provided by the Azure platform and emulate its functioning in a test environment.
